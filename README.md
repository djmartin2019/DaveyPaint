# Davey Paint

**Davey Paint** is a simple paint application built using SDL2. It allows users to draw on a canvas using a selection of colors from a palette. This project demonstrates basic SDL2 functionality, including event handling, rendering to textures, and managing render targets.

## Features

- **Color Palette**: Select from five colors (red, green, blue, yellow, black) to draw on the canvas.
- **Drawing Canvas**: Click and drag to draw on the canvas with the selected color.
- **Basic User Interface**: The application displays a simple UI with a color palette at the top of the window.

## Current Status

This project is currently in a basic functional state:

- **Implemented**:
  - Color palette rendering and color selection.
  - Drawing functionality on the canvas with the selected color.
  - SDL2 setup with window creation and rendering.

- **To Do**:
  - Add more features, such as saving the canvas as an image.
  - Implement an eraser tool.
  - Expand the color palette.
  - Add UI elements for additional tools (e.g., brush size selection).

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

Ensure that SDL2 is installed on your system. You can install it using the following:

- **Linux**: 
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
